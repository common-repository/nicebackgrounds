Manage adaptive (mobile-ready) images and automatically apply them as backgrounds. Pull beautiful photos from Unsplash or supply your own images.

== Description ==

Manage large adaptive (mobile-ready) images and automatically apply them to areas on your WordPress site as backgrounds.
Pull beautiful photos from Unsplash using the in-built browser, or supply your own images from uploads and supplied URLs.

Usage

Once activated, go to Appearance > Nice Backgrounds. You can create one or more 'sets' of background images with
different settings.

Note: This plugin typically deals with resizing very large images, if you're having problems make sure your memory limit
is sufficiently high enough to deal with some occasional heavy lifting.

Note: PNG images that are either very large or are 24-bit can be problematic.  The exact details of this are yet to be
determined.

== Installation ==

Via WordPress:
1. Install the plugin via *Plugins > Add New*.
2. Activate the plugin.

By Upload:
1. Upload the *nicebackgrounds* folder to */wp-content/plugins/*
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress

Just the other day I read a fortune cookie that said something about giving credit.  I threw it away, but here is a
list of stuff I looked at to get some ideas of what to do for this plugin:
